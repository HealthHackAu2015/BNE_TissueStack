------------

The source for the various components can be found in the following directories:

1) Frontend (html, images, css and js) => src/web
2) Java Web Services and Toolkit => src/java
3) C/C++ Services and JNI Wrappers for MINC => src/c and sub directories

For deployment use the following for each component:
1) Anything under src/web just needs to be taken and copied wherever the webserver's document root lives
2) Use Apache Maven to build the .war file ('mvn clean install' in the project's root directory) which can then be deployed in any java application server 
3) Use the Makefiles to build the c code. There will be a Makefile in the project's root directory for the default functionality and Makefiles in the sub directories of the optional plugins

!!!!!! NOTE: This is a work in progress !!!!!!
