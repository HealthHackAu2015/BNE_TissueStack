At the moment the directory structure is determined by convenience.

All the should be needed to run canvas.html is to create an evil symbolic link to this project direcory in the apache http_docs

e.g: ln -s /data/home/harald/workspace_java/TissueStack TissueStack  

and then use your browser of choice: http://localhost/TissueStack/canvas.html


ATTENTION: the example data consists of only 1 cross-section per plane. If you want more you need to tile your data and adjust the java script with the appropriate pixel bounds for each plain. !!!
