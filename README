# Tissue Stack is an open source web based image viewer which allows the user to #
# view 3D data as 2D cross sections.                                             #
#                       							 #
# While at its core it's modelled after GIS web mapping applications,            #
# it's intended use is for neuro-imaging.                                        # 
#										 #
# Tissue Stack aims at serving its data as image tiles which can be both pre-    #
# tiled in advance or created on the fly by extracting from the original source  #
# file. 									 #
#										 #
# The used file formats will be anything that is supported by the MINC Tool Kit: # 
#    http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/ServicesSoftwareMincToolKit   #
# as well as the nifti format: http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/                        #
# The TissueStack Image Server supplies converter plugins to turn the above      #
# mentioned formats into a "raw" file which is basically a stream of bytes       #
# incl. header for quick and easy sequential reads                               #

# A Tissue Stack Server Instance consists of the following components:           # 
#										 #
#   1) The WEB Front End => see src/web/README for installation instructions     #
#        									 #
#   2) A Configuration Back End => see src/java/README for further explanations  #
#										 #        
#   3) A Configuration Data Base => see src/sql/README for how to create the     #
#      data base          							 #
#										 #        
#   4) The Image Server for pre and on-the-fly tiling  => see src/c/README for   #
#      how to build and install							 #
