The Tissue Stack Configuration Services are a set of restful services (based on HTTP) to call backend functionality and query or write to 
the configuration database. They are written in Java and make use of Hibernate (for persistence), RestEasy (for restfulness) and JNI to
talk to the MINC Toolkit and our C ImageServer.

                                                               *******

Requirements:

    1) A Java SDK 1.6 or higher
    2) Apache Maven for Building
    3) Apache Tomcat (recommended) or any other Java Application Server

How to build and deploy the back-end web services? 
    
    Change into the git project root and run "mvn clean install" from the command line
    
Note:
-----
    If you have tomcat installed and the environment variable CATALINA_HOME set, then the maven build script deploys automatically to
    your tomcat's webapps folder, otherwise you have to manually copy the file!

Important:
----------
    In order for JNI to find our shared C libraries, make sure that the tomcat starts with the command line option:
        
            -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib (see also: src/c/README)
            
    e.g. with tomcat, add the following line to catalina.sh: 
    
            CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib"
    
    or alternatively use /etc/default/tomcat on Ubuntu (if tomcat was installed with apt-get)
    
    
 
ATTENTION:
----------
This is a work in progress!
