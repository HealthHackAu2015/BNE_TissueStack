This directory contains the "service" (/etc/init.d) scripts for starting and stopping the Tissue Stack Image Server as well as tomcat.

                                                          ******

Note:
-----
If you are not using tomcat and/or you installed it as part of your linux system's package manager,
you'll already have a (better) init script installed !


Important:
-----------
The 2 scripts will most likely need modification before "installing" them in the /etc/init directory

On an Ubuntu system, here are the recommended steps to integrate the scripts into the init mechanics:
(1) Modify paths to daemons in the script
(2) Remove old versions if necessary: rm /etc/rc*/*myscript
(3) Adding the service script to default runlevels: update-rc.d myscript defaults
