Note: The 2 scripts most likely need modification before "installing" them in the /etc/init directory

On an Ubuntu system, here are the recommended steps to integrate the scripts into the init mechanics:
(1) Modify paths to daemons in the script
(2) Remove old versions if necessary: rm /etc/rc*/*myscript
(3) Adding the service script to default runlevels: update-rc.d myscript defaults
