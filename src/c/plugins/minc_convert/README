This section of the TissueStack project holds the sources for the ImageServer and the JNI glue needed to talk to the TissueStack 
Configuration Services. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile the Tissue Stack Image Server, call
 
                "sudo make"

from the command line.

Note: 
------
sudo privileges are needed to install the compiled binaries (server & plugins) in the directories: /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/plugins

                                                        ******
                                                        
To compile the JNI code invoke 
            
            "sudo make"

in the sub directory jni.

This will create the necessary shared libraries, copy them into /usr/local/lib. You may need to add that path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH !



ATTENTION: This is a work in progress !
