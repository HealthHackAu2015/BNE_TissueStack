The "web" part of TissueStack contains the html, css and java script for a Tissue Stack instance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While technically any web server could serve the aforementioned components, we strongly recommend Apache Webserver 2.2 or later.

If a different web server is used, here are the 3 gottchas that need to be addressed in order to run a TissueStack installation
successfully:


1) Set the following custom header if you want to allow connections to other/remote TissueStack instances: 
        
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"

2) To enable "local" directory access to your application server, e.g. tomcat (see also src/java/README),
   a url redirect/proxying mechanism is required, pointing to your Java Application Server, e.g. http://TissueStackApplicationServer:8080
   and accessible under the /backend directory.
   
   An typical apache web server configuration (using mod_proxy) for this problem would be:
   
        ProxyPass /backend http://localhost:8080/TissueStack
        ProxyPassReverse /backend http://localhost:8080/TissueStack
   
3) Similarly to 2), the image service version is expected to be accessible under the /image_service directory which will be pointing to 
   your local installation of the TissueStackImageServer (see also: src/c/README)
             
   Once again, a typical apache web server solution could be:
   
       ProxyPass /image_service http://localhost:4242
       ProxyPassReverse /image_service http://localhost:4242

                                                           ****


Last but not least, for apache web server users, here is a template for what your virtual host configuration should look like:
(Note: Modify paths to DocumentRoot and server urls according to your needs!)


<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

    DocumentRoot /opt/workspace/TissueStack/src/web

       Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"

    ProxyPass /backend http://localhost:8080/TissueStack
    ProxyPassReverse /backend http://localhost:8080/TissueStack

        ProxyPass /image_service http://localhost:4242
        ProxyPassReverse /image_service http://localhost:4242
