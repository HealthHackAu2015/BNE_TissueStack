The C++ code can be built by simply typing: make

Here are a few further options that may be useful:

   "make compile" just compile the code after a change to any cpp (not .h !!!)
   "make install" will compile (see above) and copy the binary to:
                  /usr/local/tissustack/version.number
   "make compile-tools" same as compile option (see above) but for the tools only
   "make install-tools" same as install option (see above) but for the tools only

    Note: the targets above are "shortcuts" and do deliberately not clean before
          so as to not trigger a (slower) entire rebuild. If this is what you want
          then use "make" (simply) or "make clean ...."

For a more refined building based on targets, please consult the Makefile.
