ATTENTION:
-----------

To ensure that the application and all of its components are running correctly, please make sure that the contents of this archive have been placed into /opt, so that the extracted path is: /opt/tissuestack !!!!

It is perfectly possible to change the defaults but not without modifying various configuration values in various files and the configuration database/the sql script that creates it.


PRE-REQUISITES:
---------------

The application as is depends on a postgres installation. It is recommended to install version 8.4 or greater.A
On an Ubuntu this can be done by running "sudo apt-get install postgresql"

After a successful installation, you have to create the application's configuration database by running the sql scripts "create_tissuestack_db.sql" and "create_tissuestack_tables.sql" in the sql folder.
This is done usually by becoming the postgres user and executing it via "psql -f create_tissuestack_db.sql" to create the default user "tissuestack" with password "tissuestack" and then the database named tissuestack.
Once the db has been created, the second script will take care of the table creation. It can be executed as tissuestack user, typing the following:
"psql -U tissuestack -h localhost -f create_tissuestack_tables.sql tissuestack". You should be prompted for the password.



Comments on the Tissue Stack Dirctory Layout:
---------------------------------------------

(1) The following is a list of custom/configuration folders used by the application:


./ands  => if you choose to register your data sets with ANDS (http://www.ands.org.au/), this is where your xml files go

./colormaps  => the directory contains a collection of colormap files. to add new ones, have a look at the format of an existing one

./logs => the Tissue Stack Image Server puts its log files there

./tasks => contains a collection of files including a task queue and all individual task files

./tiles => the default location for pre-tiled data sets

./upload => the default location for uploading files

./lookup => contains files to map a text to an rgb triple which will then be displayed in the web interface.
            an example line would be (columns are separated by TABS!!!!): 
                                       2	197	197	99	yellow (hot)

./sql => database and table creation scripts that need to be executed (see PRE-REQUISITES above) to create the application's configuration database


(2) These are the runtime components needed for the application:

./apache-tomcat-X.X.X => the tomcat servlet container already including the web application archive (tissuestack.war). Note: X.X.X stands for version

./jdkX.X.X_XX => the java sdk including runtime where the Xs define the present version

./bin => helper script to start the application, in particular its 2 components, the Image Server binary and the Web Application running within tomcat
