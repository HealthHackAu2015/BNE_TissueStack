This section of the TissueStack project holds the sources for the ImageServer and the JNI glue needed to talk to the TissueStack 
Configuration Services. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile the Tissue Stack Image Server, call
 
                "sudo make"

from the command line.

Note: 
------
sudo privileges are needed to install the compiled binaries (server & plugins) in the directories: /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/plugins


ATTENTION: This is a work in progress !
