To build the .deb package, update the directory name first to reflect the proper version, e.g tissuestack-1.1 is for version 1.1.
Then update the sources contained in tissuestack-X.X and if necessary the files tissuestack-X.X/debian/control and tissuestack-X.X/debian/install

Once everything is up to date you can call the buildMe.sh script which will ask you for your sudo password.

If all goes well, the result is a tissuestack-X.X-X_architecture.deb!

IMPORTANT:
There are a few software/package pre-requisites that need to be fulfilled on your system to be able to build a debian package. Here are some resources that are helpful:
	
	http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/

and 

	http://www.webupd8.org/2010/01/how-to-create-deb-package-ubuntu-debian.html

which mentions that you need to have the following bits installed on your system to conduct a package build:

"apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake autotools-dev dh-make debhelper devscripts fakeroot xutils lintian pbuilder"
