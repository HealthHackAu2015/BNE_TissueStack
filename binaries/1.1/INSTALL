NOTES:
------

A) Step(s) 1/2 and 3 (see below) are technically independant of each other. So if you only want to use the ImageServer or only want to use the TissueStack Web Interface with pre-tiled datasets, that's perfectly possible as well.

B) For simplicity the bulk of the application's bits have been gzipped INCLUDING all its required software which makes the archive quite big, arounf 125 MB.
	



To install both components of the Tissue Stack Application, please follow these steps:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Extract tissuestack-X.X.tar.gz into /opt so that the resulting directory will be /opt/tissuestack
   If you use a different directory you'll have to tweak paths here and there, so it is not recommended that you do so!

2) Read the README located in /opt/tissuestack/README for further explanation AND to install the application's configuration database (REQUIRED!)

3) Install the Image Server by installing tissuestack_X.X_amd64.deb
   This can be done in 2 ways:
		A) Using apt-get and dpkg:
		   First run "sudo dpkg -i tissuestack_X.X_amd64.deb" which is very likely to give you an error about missing dependencies.
		   If it doesn't consider yourself lucky because you're done.
		   If if does, we can fix the missing dependencies by typing "sudo apt-get install -f".
		   Last but not least, redo the package install that failed initially: "sudo dpkg -i tissuestack_X.X_amd64.deb"
		B) Use gdebi: "sudo gdebi tissuestack_X.X_amd64.deb"
